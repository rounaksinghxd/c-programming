Operators: Operators are used in programs to manipulates data and variables. They usually form a part of the mathematical or logical expressions.
C operators can be classified into a number of categories. They include:

1. Arithmetic Oprators
  These are used for basic mathematical calculations.
  Operator          Meaning               Example (a = 10, b =3)
  +                 Addition               13
  -                 Subtraction            7
  *                 Multiplication         30
  /                 Division               a/b=3 (integer division)
  %                 Modulus (Remainder)    a%b = 1

2. Relational Operators
  These compare two values and return either true (1) or false (0).
  They are essential for decision-making.
  ==: Equal to (e.g., 5 == 5 is true)
  !=: Not equal to
  > and <: Greater than and Less than
  >= and <=: Greater/Less than or equal to
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Increment and Decrement Operators
6. Conditional Operators
7. Bitwise Operators
8. Special Operators
